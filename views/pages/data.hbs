        Although this website is for Mississippi, an open API exists for querying Coronavirus data.  <strong>Here is <a href="/api/v1/docs" target="_blank">the api documentation</a></strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the process of compiling this data, we've found that a lot of different sources conflict each other. 
          We aim to overcome these discrepancies by sharing as many sources as possible. 
          We're constantly adding new data sources, so check back here for any additions to our list.
          We also keep <a href="/api/v1/docs" target="_blank">the api documentation</a> up-to-date. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Data is currently available from three sources: 
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Johns Hopkins University</strong></li>
                <p>
                  This data provides a snapshot of each day's cases, based on county and state. Note that they didn't start sharing county data until 03-23-2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Johns Hopkins updates their data everyday at 23:59 UTC (7pm central time). We query the most recent data.
                  It comes <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target="_blank">from here.</a>
                </p>
              <li><strong>The New York Times</strong></li>
                <p>Their data is a chronological list of case counts for each day, since the first confirmed case in January. 
                  This is a good endpoint to query if you want to make data charts to see growth rates based counties and states.
                </p>
                <p>New York Times updates their data daily. It's sourced <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">from here.</a></p>
              <li><strong>Mississippi State Department of Health</strong></li>
                <p>We've found that MSDH has the most up-to-date numbers than anybody, so we constantly for updates. 
                  That API is still being refined and it has no documentation, but if you want to try it out, you can get from
                  the <code>/mississippi</code> endpoint.</p>
            </ol> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Here is <a href="/api/v1/docs" target="_blank">the api documentation</a> </strong>in case you missed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The code is <a href="https://github.com/smcalilly/mississippi-covid">available here.</a> 
          Please open an issue if you find a bug. And feel free to contribute, but excuse the mess!
          It's my first ExpressJS app.
